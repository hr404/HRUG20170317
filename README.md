Slideshow for the HRUG meeting on March 17, 2017.
The slides are about how I created a catlog of items in ArcGIS Online and how I used json to pull out the operational data from each AGOL item.
Slides have been created with slides.com and then downloaded to the reveal.js framework, which was then uploaded to this repository.
